## Running the game

### Running on real hardware

To run the game on a real Tandy 100 or 102, use a TPDD emulator (LaddieAlpha, mComm, NADSbox, etc.) and a
DOS of your choice (TS-DOS, TEENY) to load the file `CODE.DO` onto the computer. Start `BASIC` and run:

`LOAD "CODE.DO"`

Type `RUN` to execute the program.

### Running in the "Virtual-T" emulator

Obtain Virtual-T from https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualt/

Start Virtual-T, select "Model" from the "Emulation" menu, and ensure that either
M100 or M102 is selected. Open the "File" menu and choose "Load file from HD". Navigate to 
the CODE.DO file and click "Ok". The file should appear in the menu.

Start `BASIC` and run:

`LOAD "CODE.DO"`

Type `RUN` to execute the program.
